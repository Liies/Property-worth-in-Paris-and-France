## Introduction 

A property value refers to the estimated worth of a property. This **worth** depends on some ***factors*** like the : 

* **The location** : It is one of the main criterion of the valuation of a property. Indeed, the location includes for instance the city, the neiborhood, the proximity to the transports or even the exposition to the sun.
* **The area of the house** : The property's area is one of the main factors, indeed to estimate the worth of a property we have to multiply the square meter price by the are of dwelling. The layout and distribution of rooms is also very important to estimate this part of the worth. 
* **The age** : The year of construction of the building has also to be taken into account. Indeed the construction tends to degrade over time unless regular maintenance is performed.

This study was made in order to project into the future and figure out what the real estate field looks like in France. Furthermore we decided to focus this study on Paris and France where we actually live. That's why this study permits us to combine the pleasant and the useful. Focusing on Paris permitted us to see disparities between rural and urban areas.  
Moreover, this study could be interesting for potential investors with an interest in acquire real estate in France.   <br> <br>
